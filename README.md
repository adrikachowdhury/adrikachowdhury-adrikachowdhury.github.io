  <i style= "font-family: Arial;">
    Hi, I am Adrika Chowdhury, based in Chattogram, Bangladesh. I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the <a href="https://asian-university.org/">Asian University for Women</a>, and expect to graduate in 2025.<br>As a person, I believe in being friendly, dedicated, hard-working, and enthusiastic. I am also quite efficient in teamwork and organization. During my pastime, I often engage myself in digital painting, listening to music, or watching series.<br>I have been planning to do my higher studies in my major after my undergraduate studies. After completing my Bachelor's and Master's, I set my career goal to secure a high-standard job in the field of Computer Science to get enough important skills needed these days. I believe that these skills would be crucial for me to compete in the challenging world.</i>
